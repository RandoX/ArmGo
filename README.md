Inspiration form cargo-bot (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cargo-bot/id519690804) .

Cargo-bot is a very interesting game for code beginner. I love it and call my friends play it togetter. 

But it only run in iPad which lots of beginners can't get.  When I learn to HTML5, I transplant it in Javascript, so everyone can play it only needs a browser.
